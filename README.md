# Yoga Club Class Management

## *For the internal day-to-day operations of a small yoga studio*

This project is specially created for the UBC Yoga Club, but can also be extended
for any small business. This application is made to help organize the memberships of the club. 
The main users of this application would be UBC Yoga Club executives and volunteers, including myself. 

**Why was this created?**

We recently unsubscribed from our old class scheduling software due to high costs.
In its place, we've created a web of spreadsheets to keep track of our operations. 
Since spreadsheets are very limited and difficult to keep organized, I hope to 
create a better and more sustainable application, as well as add in some 
customized features that would especially benefit our club. 

The key functionalities of this application include:
- Updating memberships
- Modifying memberships
- Viewing memberships and statistics of memberships, such as total number of members
